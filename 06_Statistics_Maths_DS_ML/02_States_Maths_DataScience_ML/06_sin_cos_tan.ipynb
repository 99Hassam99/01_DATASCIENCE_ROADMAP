    "A forest officer who wants to measure a height of a tree, the tree is very big so he does not want to climb on it because it is just too much work and for that reason he is going to use the knowledge of sin cosine and tan to come up with the height of this tree very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first he will measure the distance between himself and the tree lets say it is 50 feet then he has an instrument using which he can measure an angle between the ground and the top/notch of the tree from where he's looking: let's that angle is 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this knowledge now you can find out what's the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just consider this as a right angle triangle.\n",
    "RAT is something where there is an angle of 90 degree and lets consider the height is 3 and the base is 4 for such a triangle the angle on other side will always be 36.87 degree 06_fig that is like a law of nature well what is law of nature? like 2+3=5 that is law of nature which cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If height and base is 4 the angle will always be 45 and if base is 5 and height is 4 the angle will always be 38.65 so it is kind of a fix mapping that nature has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we represent the relation between this angle and these 2 sides in a mathematical form: $$ 36.87^0 ~ 3,4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what mathematicians do, they conduct scientific experiments and then they find some relationship and they just give a name to those relationships, so sintheta, costheta is not a rocket science really it is just a relationship. It is a name that they gave to some natural law so 36.87 is related to 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say that 36.87 is related to the ratio between 3/4 becuase if you change this ratio this angle will change and if the ratio is constant lets say if 3/4 is 0.75 then this realtionship is kind of constant so mathematicians give this relationship a name called:\n",
    "Tangent $$ 36.87^0  =  0.75$$\n",
    "\n",
    "They called this tan theta.\n",
    "\n",
    "so 10 of 36.87 is 0.75 and 0.75 is the opposite side divided by adjacent side:\n",

You need to lift it a little bit so you address the friction between the backage and the ground, if we keep the rope very in a straight direction like horizontal then it might be hard to pull the packge.(Shown in 06_fig2).\n",
